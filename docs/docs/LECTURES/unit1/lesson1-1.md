# What do we know about Cybersecurity?


Cybersecurity sounds like what it is *exactly*. Cyber, meaning digital, and security, meaning safety and protection. So digital protection/prevention/safety.

But what does that really mean?


Well you could say that cybersecurity is about how we can protect computers, servers, systems, etc. from digital attacks.
These attacks oculd be viruses, worms, ransomware, etc. In order to keep sensitive data safe, we need to protect against
the exploitation of security vulnerabilities.

These are some cybersecurity goals:

- Identify and fix security vulnerabilities
- Prevent unauthorized access and data breaches
- Protect systems from malicious attacks 
- Ensure integrity and availability of information
